# Algorithmization and programming II

University class on Python programming in the second semester of the first year.

## Syllabus
1. Implementation of custom classes (data members, methods, constructors)
2. Abstract data types (ADT), implementation of sequential data structures (queue, stack, sorted list)
3. Implementation of custom algorithms over sequential collections - search algorithms
4. Implementation of custom algorithms over sequential collections - sorting algorithms
5. Connection structures and their object implementation (connection lists, trees, etc.)
6. Implementation of custom algorithms over connection structures
7. Seminar paper assignment, discussion and implementation design
8. Interface (protocols in Python), iterators and their implementation, basic collections interface
9. Full-fledged implementation of a custom collection
10. Inheritance (advantages and disadvantages)
11. Practical use of inheritance
